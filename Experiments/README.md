# Experiments

## 1. Width Size

- Do filters in Fourier optimize to better behaved functions than those in pixel space?
- Are filters in Fourier equivalent to filters in pixel space with **very big** kernel sizes?

## 2. Real and Imaginary parts

- Should we use the same filter for the Real and Imaginary parts or should we use differents?
- In (Wood 2021) they use different if I recall correctly.

## 3. Classification

- Different datasets
  + Cifar10
  + Cifar100
  + Imagenette
  + ImageNet
- Parametric in Pixel space vs Parametric in Fourier
- Compare with non-parametric with L2 regularization: L2 regularization should enforce not-so-wide kernels.

## 4. (Parametric) PerceptNet vs Fourier (Parametric) PerceptNet

- Wouldn't do it as of know because Parametric PerceptNet is not published yet :(
